			<h1 id="lal"><center>Introduction</center></h1>
			<h4 id="ldl" class="ex"><center>Music as a whole is a talent and a gift to whoever wishes to use it. It can be used to tell stories, or can be made to give pleasure to the ears. Music can express different emotions throughout its chords, whether it is a slow or fast paced tune. There are many forms of music, all special im their own way, but their are a few genres that stick out from all of the rest. To myself, these are my favorite song and tunes that I listen to nearly every day. </center></h4>

			<h1 id="lal"><center>Song 1</center></h1>
			<h3 id="ldl"><center>Another One Bites the Dust - Queen</center></h3>
			<center><iframe src="./Music_ Orchestral Magic_files/saved_resource.html" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>
			<h4 id="ldl" class="ex"><center>Another One Bites the Dust by the band Queen was made out to the public in 1980. It has been a famous song and has had many remixs made over the years. It has a repetative beat that goes on for three minutes and thirty four seconds that leaves the song in the person listening's head for a while. The song was rated first in the US Billboard for three weeks which made it one of the most popular song in America (take that Taylor Swift). Overall the song, even though it gets dull after a while, is a entertaining thing to listen to and will be for years to come.</center></h4>

			<h1 id="lal"><center>Song 2</center></h1>
			<h3 id="ldl"><center>Shia LaBeouf Live - By Rob Cantor</center></h3>
			<center><iframe src="./Music_ Orchestral Magic_files/saved_resource(1).html" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>
			<h4 id="ldl" class="ex"><center>If there was comedy in the form of a song this would definently be it. Besides having a nice tune, the lyrics of Rob Cantors "Shia Labeouf" is down right hilarious! Making a song based on a actor that has become a meme was one of the best ideas that any song writer has ever had. They hired tons of stunt artists, musicians, and singers to make a song that was literally just for a joke. Even throughout the hilarity of the song the best part of it was at the end in the video where they actually got the real Shia Labeouf in on the song and put him in the video. Overall the song was a good tune that I will listen to for probally the rest of my life</center></h4>

			<h1 id="lal"><center>Song 3</center></h1>
			<h3 id="ldl"><center>Freaks - Timmy Trumpet</center></h3>
			<center><iframe src="./Music_ Orchestral Magic_files/saved_resource(2).html" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>
			<h4 id="ldl" class="ex"><center>This song is probally my favorite song out of all five of these songs. It is a perfect blend of different genres and has a very catchy beat that you just cannot get out of your head. This song has been in countless comercials and TV programs and also has a youtube video of a dad and his son doing the same beat that the song does. Throughout the song it keeps on getting better and better, so when it stops you just want to replay it over and over again. This song is a true masterpiece that almost everyone in the world will love and use for generations to come.</center></h4>

			<h1 id="lal"><center>Song 4</center></h1>
			<h3 id="ldl"><center>Big Balls - AC/DC</center></h3>
			<center><iframe src="./Music_ Orchestral Magic_files/saved_resource(3).html" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>
			<h4 id="ldl" class="ex"><center>Before I begin the summary of this song, this song is talking about ballroom dancing and not those other types of balls. AC/DC decided to make this a comedy song that is about ballroom dancing, but they also wanted to put in something else to make it funny, hence why in the song it sounds like they are singing about the other types of balls that we have come to love and enjoy. This song, like its Shia Labeouf counterpart, is a comedy song that has a nice beat and funny lyrics. AC/DC worked really hard on making this song sound appropriate enough to not get a warning on it, and in the end it payed off. This song has made me laugh so many times and will probally make others laugh who listen too its wonderful tune.</center></h4>

			<h1 id="lal"><center>Song 5</center></h1>
			<h3 id="ldl"><center>Scatman - Scatman John</center></h3>
			<center><iframe src="./Music_ Orchestral Magic_files/saved_resource(4).html" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>
			<h4 id="ldl" class="ex"><center>This song can be summed up in just one word random. This songs lyrics, are random. This songs beat, is random. Even the lyrics in this song sounds like a todler trying to say its first words, and that is what makes this song so good. Scatman John (if that is his real name) figured out how to incorperate the word scatman into sounding like a funk tenchno beat that sounds wonderful. I can only imagine how long it took to reherse the lyrics and figure out how to say each and every word until it was a complete song. Even though the song can get confusing at times, it has such a good tune that it instantly became one of my favorite songs.</center></h4>
